# ser515_ICA-8-Testing

In this “How many Urinals are free?” problem, input is taken from the terminal (0 is taken as input in this case) or in .dat format (1 is taken as input in this case). In this implementation, the output is written in a .txt file, and indices are given to the file name based on whether the output file is already present or not. In the input string, if we have any two consecutive 1s, -1 is returned. Else, the number of available urinals is printed by checking if the current index element is 0 and the previous and next index elements are 0.
